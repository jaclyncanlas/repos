# What this Repo contains

This repo contains my progress regarding developing programming proficiency from scratch. There are three tracks:

1. python-fundamentals
    - Here I relearn and become more comfortable with the fundamental building blocks.
2. dsa-patterns
    - Here I learn about various DSA to prepare myself for interviews.
3. mini-projects
    - Here I write mini-applications to accelerate my understanding of various concepts and with solving problems.

Treating this repo as a public notebook.
